# Scholar_Success_Fund : Advanced Database System for Financial Aid
Create an advanced database system that complies with banking standards and provides financial aid to students for education in the form of scholarships and educational loans.

Using this system, we seek to efficiently analyze and determine studentâ€™s eligibility for education loans and scholarships, leveraging a wide range of financial and educational criteria. Ultimately, it ensures fair distribution of financial aid, promoting educational access and student success.
